# airbnb-clone-project
This project is a full-stack clone of the popular accommodation booking platform AirBnB. The goal is to build a functional web application that allows users to browse property listings, view detailed property information, and complete bookings. The project will cover frontend development, backend APIs, database design, and deployment.

# Frontend
## Project goals

2. Implement a fully responsive layout that provides seamless user experiences on all devices.
3. Have organized and well-documented codebase following the best project practices.
4. Implement the key interactive features.
5. Optimize the web app with ARIA's set of attributes to be inclusive to people with disabilities.
6. Building the wireframes and prototypes of the app.

## Importance of a user-friendly design in a booking platform
A user-friendly design directly increases revenue as customers are more likely to complete the path from discovery to purchase.
People are more likely to trust a professional and intuitive interface, as it creates enhanced trust with the brand.
The consistent design translates into customer retention. Previous smooth experiences can result in the customers going back to use your product.
The intuitive navigation and clear information prevent user frustration, and prevent losing users to competitors. 

## Figma Design Specifications
### Color Styles:
- **Primary**: #FF5A5F
- **Secondary**: #008489
- **Background**: #FFFFFF
- **Text**: #222222
- **Secondary Text**: #717171

## Typography:
- **Primary Font**: Circular, Medium (500), 16px
- **Headings**: Circular, Bold (700), 24px-32px

## Importance of identifying design properties of a mock-up design
- The consistency allows you to create a style guide, creating a professional, cohesive user experience. It also reinforces the brand's visual identity.
- There can be reusable components that can be built and reused instead of styling every component individually.
- It ensures the initial design and the final product are matched.
