# Importance of a user-friendly design in a booking platform
A user-friendly design directly increases revenue as customers are more likely to complete the path from discovery to purchase.
People are more likely to trust a professional and intuitive interface, as it creates enhanced trust with the brand.
The consistent design translates into customer retention. Previous smooth experiences can result in the customers going back to use your product.
The intuitive navigation and clear information prevent user frustration, and prevent losing users to competitors.
